            This new App changes everything. Redesigned homepage & navigation got the Notification tab. 
<br/><br/>
With Cash displayed on top no further actions to check Airlift Wallet, essentially saving User Time & Shopping Mood. Based on a heatmap research, I changed the Add to Cart, nudged the Plus & Minus making it much easier for Small Screen Size devices to interact with perfect touches.
<br/><br/>
Overall, the App is uplifted the Cart is minimal but quick to action so user gets the most important information without jumping eyeballs.
<br/><br/>
The Delivery Tracker screen for users has a awful reputation. Now fixed it with appropriate fonts & updated layout. Most importantly, now Users have basic identification information of the incoming Rider. This helps them track their delivery more efficiently. Rider Identification made easier now information such as Bike Model, Rider Name & Headshot Image is available. Additionally, users can communicate Rider directly through the App. This is a relief for both ends Rider â€“ User.
<br/><br/>
Currently, the Airlift App keeps a track of all Past Orders. Yet if you want to track when a specific individual product was last ordered. You'd have to manually dig down into every Past Order. That long voyage has been addressed, users can now type in a specific product and pull out information. 
<br/><br/>
Definitely, the Airlift Project more than redesigned is redefined. Mission was preserving the Original Interface such that current users must not feel irritated with the updated one considering the User Base which is not so Internet Aware. The Pitch is pretty successful, Airlift Team has taken this into considerations & appreciated the efforts, I'm excited to see it coming up!
