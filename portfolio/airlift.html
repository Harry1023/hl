        <h2>Story</h2>

        <p>I'm a regular Airlift Customer & always had a awesome experience with them. Yet one day, the order was getting delayed just because the rider wasn't able to reach the pin point location. At this time, Airlift has no Rider â€“ User connection means you cannot connect the rider directly on the app.This was a headache, I had to go out walking to search the Rider without any identification information (Eg. Bike No, Model, Type). During this time, the Airlift Team notified me on call that I have received a Coupon Code in the Notifications Tab. Unfortunately, again the Notifications Tab wasn't so easy to find due to its bad location & I had to miss the Coupon.</p>
