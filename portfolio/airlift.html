<h2>Story</h2>

    <p>I'm a regular Airlift Customer &amp; always had a awesome experience with them. Yet one day, the order was getting delayed just because the rider wasn't able to reach the pin point location. At this time, Airlift has no Rider – User communication you cannot connect the rider directly on the app. this was a headache, I had to go out walking to search the Rider without any identification information (Eg. Bike No, Model, Type). During this time, the Airlift Team notified me on call that I have received a Coupon Code in the Notifications Tab. Unfortunately, again the Notifications Tab wasn't so easy to find due to its bad location &amp; I had to miss the Coupon.</p>
<br><br>
    
        <h2>Updates &amp; Developments</h2>

        <p>
            
            This new App changes everything. Redesigned homepage &amp; navigation got the Notification tab. 
<br><br>
With Cash displayed on top no further actions to check Airlift Wallet, essentially saving User Time &amp; Shopping Mood. Based on a heatmap research, I changed the Add to Cart, nudged the Plus &amp; Minus making it much easier for Small Screen Size devices to interact with perfect touches.
<br><br>
Overall, the App is uplifted the Cart is minimal but quick to action so user gets the most important information without jumping eyeballs.
<br><br>
The Delivery Tracker screen for users has a awful reputation. Now fixed it with appropriate fonts &amp; updated layout. Most importantly, now Users have basic identification information of the incoming Rider. This helps them track their delivery more efficiently. Rider Identification made easier now information such as Bike Model, Rider Name &amp; Headshot Image is available. Additionally, users can communicate Rider directly through the App. This is a relief for both ends Rider – User.
<br><br>
Currently, the Airlift App keeps a track of all Past Orders. Yet if you want to track when a specific individual product was last ordered. You'd have to manually dig down into every Past Order. That long voyage has been addressed, users can now type in a specific product and pull out information. 
<br><br>
Definitely, the Airlift Project more than redesigned is redefined. Mission was preserving the Original Interface such that current users must not feel irritated with the updated one considering the User Base which is not so Internet Aware. The Pitch is pretty successful, Airlift Team has taken this into considerations &amp; appreciated the efforts, I'm excited to see it coming up!

       <h2>Role</h2>

        <p>As a lead role in the project, implementing layout, UI design, typography based on the mini survey of 50+ regular airlift customers. Documentation &amp; FAQs satisfaction across the board. High end mockup developments, pitch deck &amp; video was also part of my job.
