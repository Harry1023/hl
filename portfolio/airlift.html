<h2>Story</h2>

    <p>I'm a regular Airlift Customer &amp; always had a awesome experience with them. Yet one day, the order was getting delayed just because the rider wasn't able to reach the pin point location. At this time, Airlift has no Rider â€“ User communication you cannot connect the rider directly on the app. this was a headache, I had to go out walking to search the Rider without any identification information (Eg. Bike No, Model, Type). During this time, the Airlift Team notified me on call that I have received a Coupon Code in the Notifications Tab. Unfortunately, again the Notifications Tab wasn't so easy to find due to its bad location &amp; I had to miss the Coupon.</p>
<br><br>


       <h2>Role</h2>

        <p>As a lead role in the project, implementing layout, UI design, typography based on the mini survey of 50+ regular airlift customers. I also ensured that documentation and FAQs were satisfactory across the board. Additionally, High end mockup developments, pitch deck &amp; video was also part of my job.</p> 
<br><br>



<h2>Constraints</h2>


<p>As this project was part of a Pitch Project which doesn't include fundings from the Target Company as well has a very limited time & guidelines backed by only limited Analytics that are allowed by company's board member. The project had to be completed within 2 Months and was required to preserve company's current design guidelines as well ensuring that the new interface must be adaptable for everyone including majority that isn't tech savvy.</p>
            
      


        <br><br>



        <h2>Research & Findings</h2>


        <p>I had to conclude if my issues were limited to me or it was a general issue among the users. Also unveiling other major issues that may be hurting the User Experience (UX).</p>


        <p>            
            I started with a Mini Survey and Analytics backed by the Airlift's existing Analytics Report captured in early May right after the current version was stable launched by the Airlift Dev team.
            This definetely had alot of data that was crucial in further development of the app.</p>



            <br>


            <p>Here are some of the important findings</p>
            <br>


<div id="createFlex-e4872">


<div class="e4872">

<h3>15%</h3>

<p>of Active Buyers weren't able to track their past orders efficiently. The app's already built past orders page did not offer a search to quickly filter items from past orders list.</p>

</div>
<div class="e4872">


<h3>Managing Balances</h3>

<p>Due to bad hierarchy, many users were unable to calculate their current available balance AKA Airlift Coins which is a interchangeable virtual currency that can be used for other Airlift Services. Many had resorted to paying exact amount even if it needed to slash certain items of the order.</p>


</div>

<div class="e4872">


    <h3>38%</h3>

    <p>of Active Buyers were calling Customer Support to ensure if there order was on the way. Apparently, Riders also showed frustration that their call to provide a sustainable Rider User connection via the App was neglected. This issue had indeed hit the CX really hard.</p>

        <h2>Updates &amp; Developments</h2>

        <p>
            
            The homepage and navigation have been redesigned, and a notification tab has been added to the interface.
<br><br>
With Cash prominently displayed on top, users need no further actions to check Airlift Wallet, essentially reducing Dwelling Time &amp; enhancing Shopping Experience. Based on a heatmap research, "Add to Cart" feature has been improved, nudged the Plus &amp; Minus to enable easy interaction especially on Small Screen Size devices.
<br><br>
Overall, the App is optimized. with a minimal cart design that enables quick action so user gets the most important information without jumping eyeballs.
<br><br>
The Delivery Tracker screen for users has a awful reputation. Now fixed it with appropriate fonts &amp; updated layout. Users can now have basic identification information of the incoming Rider. This helps them track their delivery more efficiently. Rider Identification made easier now information such as Bike Model, Rider Name &amp; Headshot Image is available. This feature makes tracking delivery more efficient, and users can communicate directly with the rider through the app. This enhancement brings relief to both the rider and the user.
<br><br>
Currently, the Airlift App keeps a track of all Past Orders. Yet if you want to track when a specific individual product was last ordered. You'd have to manually dig down into every Past Order. That long voyage has been addressed, users can now type in a specific product and pull out information. 
<br><br>
The project team's mission was to preserve the original interface to ensure that existing users were not inconvenienced by the updated design. The Pitch is pretty successful, Airlift Team has taken this into considerations &amp; appreciated the efforts, I'm excited to see it coming up!
