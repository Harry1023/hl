       <h2>Role & Constraints</h2>

    <p>Conducting User Interviews, collaborate with multinational team, analyze & innovate new features based on the reports. A Eight Weeks Project with tedious schedule as most of User Interviews
        were conducted during Late Shifts along with regular online meetings with other team members.
    </p>
       <br><br>



<h2>Focus Group Persona</h2>

<p>With a User Base of 100K+ we had to segregate aggressively based on factors such as Geolocation, Interests, Hobbies,  </p>
            
      


        <br><br>







        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

<p>

    To get a sense of the strengths and weaknesses of competition, I used & analyzed several online on the go Video   and management apps. I also explored color palettes of apps in the market so that I could determine appropriate colors for my app.

</p>
           <br><br>




        <h2>Research & Findings</h2>


        <p>I had to conclude if my issues were limited to me or it was a general issue among the users. Also unveiling other major issues that may be hurting the User Experience (UX).</p>


        <p>            
            I started with a Mini Survey and Analytics backed by the Airlift's existing Analytics Report captured in early May right after the current version was stable launched by the Airlift Dev team.
            This definetely had alot of data that was crucial in further development of the app.</p>



            <br>


            <p>Here are some of the important findings</p>
            <br>


<div id="createFlex-e4872">


<div class="e4872">

<h3>15%</h3>

<p>of Active Buyers weren't able to track their past orders efficiently. The app's already built past orders page did not offer a search to quickly filter items from past orders list.</p>

</div>
<div class="e4872">


<h3>Managing Balances</h3>

<p>Due to bad hierarchy, many users were unable to calculate their current available balance AKA Airlift Coins which is a interchangeable virtual currency that can be used for other Airlift Services. Many had resorted to paying exact amount even if it needed to slash certain items of the order.</p>


</div>

<div class="e4872">


    <h3>38%</h3>

    <p>of Active Buyers were calling Customer Support to ensure if there order was on the way. Apparently, Riders also showed frustration that their call to provide a sustainable Rider User connection via the App was neglected. This issue had indeed hit the CX really hard.</p>

        <h2>Updates &amp; Developments</h2>

        <p>
            
            The homepage and navigation have been redesigned, and a notification tab has been added to the interface.
<br><br>
With Cash prominently displayed on top, users need no further actions to check Airlift Wallet, essentially reducing Dwelling Time &amp; enhancing Shopping Experience. Based on a heatmap research, "Add to Cart" feature has been improved, nudged the Plus &amp; Minus to enable easy interaction especially on Small Screen Size devices.
<br><br>
Overall, the App is optimized. with a minimal cart design that enables quick action so user gets the most important information without jumping eyeballs.
<br><br>
The Delivery Tracker screen for users has a awful reputation. Now fixed it with appropriate fonts &amp; updated layout. Users can now have basic identification information of the incoming Rider. This helps them track their delivery more efficiently. Rider Identification made easier now information such as Bike Model, Rider Name &amp; Headshot Image is available. This feature makes tracking delivery more efficient, and users can communicate directly with the rider through the app. This enhancement brings relief to both the rider and the user.
<br><br>
Currently, the Airlift App keeps a track of all Past Orders. Yet if you want to track when a specific individual product was last ordered. You'd have to manually dig down into every Past Order. That long voyage has been addressed, users can now type in a specific product and pull out information. 
<br><br>
The project team's mission was to preserve the original interface to ensure that existing users were not inconvenienced by the updated design. The Pitch is pretty successful, Airlift Team has taken this into considerations &amp; appreciated the efforts, I'm excited to see it coming up!
