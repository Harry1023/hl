       <h2>Role & Constraints</h2>

    <p>Conducting User Interviews, collaborate with multinational team, analyze & innovate new features based on the reports. A Eight Weeks Project with tedious schedule as most of User Interviews
        were conducted during Late Shifts along with regular online meetings with other team members.
    </p>
       <br><br>



<h2>Focus Group Persona</h2>

<p>With a User Base of 100K+ we had to segregate aggressively based on factors such as Geolocation, Interests, Hobbies, Backgrounds. The focused group was formed by picking individual from every major group. These major groups were individuals with similar interests determined based on Round A segregation. Each member of focus group represented a major group, each were given special names for further classification.</p>
            
      


        <br>







        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

<p>

    To get a sense of the strengths and weaknesses of competition, I used & analyzed several online on the go Video Editing apps. We also had conducted a special interview series aimed at individuals that have background in Video Editing & Content Creation. The focus was to determine what matters for them.
    <br/><br/>

    This included giving them free speech on what features can be added to the app if technical & corporate limitations weren't present. This was a breakthrough as we came up with ideas that could've never been imagined with regular CX Reviews.

<br/><br/>
Some of the notable discoveries include:
<ul>
    <li>Content Creators are frustrated that very few Video Editors allow directly importing Social Media clips to Workflow.</li>
    <li>Video Editing products are slow and unpredictable. Saved files are usually wasted due to application crashes.</li>
    <li>Due to poor infrastructure the applications usually aren't Cloud Compatible. The on the go web-based is just a nightmare.</li>
    <li>Users hate the fact despite paying heavy bills no apps can handle real time rendering with GPU consuming tasks via weak devices.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Suggested Policy Reforming</h2>

        <h2>Technical Discussion & Limitations</h2>


        <p>Findings were brought to table with stakeholders and technical teams along with development teams. This was a multinational setup conducted over series of meetings. We had to conclude what was possible and what will always remain a dream thanks to technical and corporate limitations.</p>


            <br>
            <p>Here are some of the key finalizations</p>
            <br>

<div class="e4872">

<h3>Corporate Limitations</h3>

<p>YouTube & other major social media applications have rigorous copyright laws protecting their content from being redistributed. These laws extend to an exten that even Wondershare Group is disallowed to special access.</p>

</div>
<div class="e4872">


<h3>Strict Timeline</h3>

<p>Initially, several updates were suggested that were cut down due to budget reasons. Later on, company put down several new features citing stict timeline & technical mismanagement that happened due to Post Covid Lockdowns in China. Wondershare Group being a Chinese company adheres to these laws.</p>

<div class="e4872">


    <h3>80%</h3>

    <p>of Active Users were not ready to pay premium for the product in near future. Considering this, budget was driven towards marketing also introduction of AI based tools were favored & being pushed.</p>

        <h2>Updates &amp; Developments</h2>

      <p>
        
        With significant progress on the horizon, the Media IO project is a substantial undertaking that is set to continue its development phase as of February 23rd. The company has implemented significant measures to accelerate this process, actively soliciting user feedback. I am currently no longer part of the team since my contract-based opportunity concluded in February 23rd. During my time on the project, I also assisted other team members in creating additional prototypes for various editor-integrated tools. Unfortunately, these prototypes cannot be shared due to the company's stringent policies.
