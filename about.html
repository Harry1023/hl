        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I'm Harris Larry a Coder turned not your average UX/UI Designer. Since a young age, I'm passionate about Psychology which eventually led me to my dream role of UX/UI Designer. I'm currently learning funded trading and hoping to advance my skillset.</p>

        <p>As a youngling, I started out as a Basic Web Developer which was pretty serious task back in the 2012 along with my family partners who ran a Local Magazine in Dublin. Considering the fact, Dublin had advanced so fast in Media the Internet was the new norm. The Magazine Publishing Industry were suffering losses and that's when we
            decided to develop a Internet Magazine. I still remember, how hard we had to try to get the visual appeal even after that it was certainly not close to a good looking publish with no UX/UI Tools & no Training we tried a lot to make it look good however all things were failing. Even though the Magazine later failed in 2015 due to
            depleting sales I found some International Clients knocking at my door to design their Website.

            This was a turning point in my life. As a youngling, there was nothing more interesting than to build websites & earn at home. Things started to change in 2016 when I randomly stumbled across a boring crypto trading website offering guaranteed return on investment and thought
            I could double my savings. Turned out to be a International Scam I saw my wallet go blank. Being devastated, I continued to advance my journey.

            After years of working primarily as a Web Developer and more importantly a Negotiator & Account Manager. These soft skills helped me get hired at multiple companies. With so much exposure to dealing with clients, which is a real hard task. I then kicked off my journey as a UX Research Junior conducting user interviews, generating reports & developing responsive websites. Working in these agile environments combined with my sales experience not only taught me how to utilize user-centered principles to solve complex business problems,  but also pushed me to grow as both a designer and researcher.

        <p>I'm an outward extrovert, looking for critiques.</p>
